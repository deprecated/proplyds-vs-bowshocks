* Proplyds vs bow shocks vs EGGs vs globulettes

+ Many papers get confused between these different categories

  + globulette :: photo-evaporating pre-stellar cloud core

  + EGG :: photo-evaporating globule with embedded protostar

  + proplyd :: photo-evaporating circumstellar disk

  + bow shock :: star-stream interaction



* Shape of proplyd vd bow shocks
+ This was my initial inspiration
+ Yusef-Zadeh:2015a claim "proplyds" in Galactic center
  + but they look too triangular, more like bow shocks

* Proplyd-like objects in other regions

** Carina
Has possible bona fide proplyds, plus a bunch of EGGs, and a load of globulettes

** Cygnus
+ Wright:2012a
  + Bunch of objects of size 5e4 to 1e5 AU
  + No way are they proplyds, since that would require a disk with radius 1e4 AU
  + They point out that the Cygnus, NGC 3603, and Orion proplyds lie on a linear size vs distance from ionizing stars relation
    + But this is completely bogus: the ionizing luminosities are very different, and the relation is not linear within Orion
