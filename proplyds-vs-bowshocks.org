* Proplyds vs bow shocks vs EGGs vs globulettes

+ Many papers get confused between these different categories

  + globulette :: photo-evaporating pre-stellar cloud core

  + EGG :: photo-evaporating globule with embedded protostar

  + proplyd :: photo-evaporating circumstellar disk

  + bow shock :: star-stream interaction



* Shape of proplyd vs bow shocks
+ This was my initial inspiration
+ Yusef-Zadeh:2015a claim "proplyds" in Galactic center
  + but they look too triangular, more like bow shocks
+ Measure planitude and alatude for proplyds, to compare with values for bow shocks
+ Come up with some way of measuring the shape when you don't know where the star is
  + One possibility is to use the center of curvature
    + Either the center itself, or a point intermediate between there and the apex
    + So that would be assuming a value for the planitude
  + Second possibility is to use the width of the brightness distribution to set a scale
    + We could fit a 2d Gaussian to the brightness map
    + This would work best for relatively fat shells, where the curvature wouldn't matter so much
    + Or we could do something sophisticated, such as fit a curved 2D gaussian
      + Product of a gaussian in R and a gaussian in \theta
      + A * G(\theta; \theta_0, \sigma_\theta) * G(R; R_0, \sigma_R)
      + Where R and \theta are with respect to a center of curvature (x_0, y_0)
      + So that is 7 parameters in total
        + (we could make them skew Gaussians if we wanted to go crazy)
        + (and we could also make \sigma_R a function of \theta to allow flaring, something like 1 + a \theta^2)

* Proplyd-like objects in other regions

** Carina
Has possible bona fide proplyds, plus a bunch of EGGs, and a load of globulettes

** Cygnus
+ Wright:2012a
  + Bunch of objects of size 5e4 to 1e5 AU
  + No way are they proplyds, since that would require a disk with radius 1e4 AU
  + They point out that the Cygnus, NGC 3603, and Orion proplyds lie on a linear size vs distance from ionizing stars relation
    + But this is completely bogus: the ionizing luminosities are very different, and the relation is not linear within Orion
